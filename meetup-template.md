A nice, short, and seasonal introduction!

Little blurp on things we will do this Edition, giving a general idea what we will do this meetup. So we have the following agenda:

- 18:00 Open the doors
- 18:30 Welcome
- Potential slots for 5 minutes of stage time (Lightning Talks)
- _A non-talk activity for the meetup group from one of our regular formats_
- _A talk from user grouop member, that has been oragnized via the GitHub repo_
- Hang out, have beers, coke, mate or whats-o-ever and talk Elixir 🍻

Place for Abstracts of talks, speaker intros, or other lenghty content.

🎉 We may be schnittchen 🎉 

P.S. HH.ex is not your regular bite-sized conference. This is an inclusive space, that is from the local Elixir community for the local Elixir community. We rely on your input! Everything regarding this meetup is organized in public.

📣 We are always looking for content, if you'd like to give a talk or prepare a coding kata please join us.
