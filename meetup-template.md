# A template to create a new meetup event

**Start time:** 06:30 PM

Headline:

## Month Edition

Example:
```
💻 Please maybe bring your Laptop, we want to code together! 💻

A nice, short, and seasonal introduction!

Little blurp on things we will do this Edition, giving a general idea what we will do this meetup. So we have the following agenda:

- 18:00 Open the doors
- 18:30 Welcome
- Potential slots for 5 minutes of stage time (Lightning Talks)
- _A non-talk activity for the meetup group from one of our regular formats_
- _A talk from user grouop member, that has been oragnized via the GitHub repo_
- Hang out, have beers, coke, mate or whats-o-ever and talk Elixir 🍻

Place for Abstracts of talks, speaker intros, or other lenghty content.

🎉 We may be schnittchen 🎉
